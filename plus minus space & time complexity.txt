Plus Minus:

Time complexity: O(n)

The time complexity of this code is linear because the for loop will iterate an increasing amount of times dependent on the array size and do a constant amount of work for each iteration.

Space complexity: O(c)

The space complexity of this code will be constant because it uses the same amount of variables regardless of the input size.
